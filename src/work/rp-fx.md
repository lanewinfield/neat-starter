  <div class="full">How do you make a physical sequencer on the back of a cereal
  box? By using the cereal itself as the controller. An AR webapp tracks
  individual puffs in each step of the sequencer and works across all 3 RP-FX
  boxes (one beat, one lead, one bass) to create a complete track.<br><br></div>
