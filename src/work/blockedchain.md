  <div class="full">"For discerning trolls, getting blocked on Twitter is a
  badge of honor. But the only way to brag about it is by posting a screenshot.
  Enter the revolutionary, world-saving magic of Web3.<br><br>

  Blockedchain is a new kind of NFT that commemorates notable blocks on Twitter. Log in with Twitter, prove that you’re blocked by one of our chosen accounts, and we’ll mint you a commemorative NFT free of charge. With this cryptographically verified token, distributed across a ledger maintained by millions of computers consuming gigawatts of electricity, you can finally prove you’ve reached the hallowed echelon of people Gary Vaynerchuck doesn’t want to hear from."<br><br></div>
